                <p>About DAYANITA SINGH .</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dayanita Singh (born 18 March 1961)[1] is an Indian photographer whose primary format is the book. She has published fourteen books.

                        Singh's art reflects and expands on the ways in which people relate to photographic images. Her later works, drawn from her extensive photographic oeuvre, 
                        are a series of mobile museums allowing her images to be endlessly edited, sequenced, archived and displayed. Stemming from her interest in the archive, 
                        the museums present her photographs as interconnected bodies of work that are full of both poetic and narrative possibilities.</li>
                    <li>Publishing is also a significant part of Singh's practice. She has created multiple "book-objects"  works that are concurrently books, 
                        art objects, exhibitions, and catalogues  often with the publisher Steidl. Museum Bhavan has been shown at the Hayward Gallery, London (2013),
                         the Museum f√ºr Moderne Kunst, Frankfurt (2014), the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago (2014) and the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art, New Delhi (2016).</li>
                    <li>
                        Early life and background
                     Singh was born in New Delhi on 18 March 1961.[4] She was the oldest of four sisters.
                     Singh studied Visual Communication at the National Institute of Design in Ahmedabad and later Documentary Photography at the International Center of Photography in New York City.
                     She started her career in photojournalism and retired in the late 1990s. </li>

                     <li>
                        Singh's first foray into photography and bookmaking came through a chance encounter with tabla player Zakir Hussain, 
                        when he invited her to photograph him in rehearsal after she was shoved by an aggressive official while attempting to shoot him in concert. 
                        For the six winters following, Singh documented several Hussain tours and, in 1986, finally published the images in her first book, Zakir Hussain.
                         Referring to him as her first "true guru", Singh believes that Hussain taught her the most important of all skills: focus.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Singh's second book, Myself Mona Ahmed was published in 2001, after more than a decade spent on assignment as a photojournalist.
                         A mix of photobook, biography, autobiography and fiction, this 'visual novel' emerged as a result of her refusal to be the subject of what could 
                         have been a routine but problematic photojournalistic project as well as her discomfort with the West's tendency to view India through simplistic, exotic lenses.
